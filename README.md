# How to access & use the project
There is an HTML file that has been attached to the repository. 
The HTML file is where the user can test the code written within the JavaScript file. 
The HTML file redirects the user to a blank webpage where prompts will appear.
Within these prompts, the user will be asked to enter the temperature, the metric to convert from, and the metric to convert to.
Once the user has entered this information, the page will go blank, which is when the user needs to press "CTRL Shift J" to open the console.
Within the console, the user will find the converted temperature and the metric to convert to.
