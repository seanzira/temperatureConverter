# Temperature Meter Converter
## Description
For the first Capstone Project in my HyperionDev bootcamp (Level 1). We were tasked with writing the code for a temperature meter converter. How this JavaScript code works is by 
requesting the user to enter the temperature that they would like to convert, as well as the metric they're using for the conversion. Upon 
completion of entry, the user is then requested to enter the metric that they would like to convert to , and once that is done, the code returns the converted temperature with the 
converted metric.

# How to access & use the project

There is an HTML file that has been attached to the repository. 

The HTML file is where the user can test the code written within the JavaScript file. 

The HTML file redirects the user to a blank webpage where prompts will appear.

Within these prompts, the user will be asked to enter the temperature, the metric to convert from, and the metric to convert to.

Once the user has entered this information, the page will go blank, which is when the user needs to press "CTRL Shift J" to open the console.

Within the console, the user will find the converted temperature and the metric to convert to.
